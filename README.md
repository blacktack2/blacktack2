### Hi there 👋

- 🧔 My name is Stuart
- 🎓 I am a masters student at Newcastle University on the MSComp Computer Science (Game Engineer) course
- 💻 Programming is both my occupation and hobby
- 🧩 I like to collect twisty puzzles (Rubik's cubes)
- 😄 I had pronouns once, but I put them down where I knew I'd find them again and haven't seen them since
